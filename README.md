# Smart_Spotify_Player
This program will play songs from one of your spotify playlists in order of longest time since last listened. You must listen to the songs through the program for it to work correctly as it saves the song play time while you are running the program. It will save this data to a local pickel file with a dictionary for the play dates of each song and adding songs as you add songs to your playlist.
